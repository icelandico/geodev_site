"The Regulators" is presented as a mirror novel to "Desperation." Both novels share common characteristics: the main villain (the demon Tak), certain locations, and, above all, the characters. They share the same names and similar character traits, but their roles in the novel are different.

Plot-wise, this is one of the most chaotic and twisted King novels I've read. It starts brilliantly and intensely – a vehicle from the cartoon "MotoCop 2000" arrives on a quiet street in a small Ohio town and opens fire on everyone it encounters. Chaos ensues... The plot is interwoven with elements that reveal a bit of the world known from the "Dark Tower" series. As a fan of that series, I really appreciate these little details scattered throughout the various novels. Above all, we learn more about the motivations and methods of operation of the main villain – the demon Tak.

I was very surprised by the ending, which I found controversial. The way the characters deal with this ancient evil is absurd and somewhat disrupts the positive impression I had while reading the novel. A major plus, however, is the narrative style. In addition to the classic action, there are fragments of newspaper clippings, notes, and letters from past heroes. This provides a broader narrative context for both novels.
