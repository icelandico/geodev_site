A planned duel between two ideological enemies is canceled due to the unexpected death of one of the men. The protagonist's nemesis perished before the duel could take place. The problem could be considered resolved, but the protagonist is thus drawn into a vortex of mysterious and puzzling events that will ultimately lead to an explanation.

As in Grabiński's other novellas, the action unfolds very slowly. Most of the time is spent with the protagonist's reflections on the world around him and the situation he finds himself in. The novella contains elements of crime fiction, psychology, and atmospheric horror. However, it is not Lovecraftian horror. Although the protagonist also faces the unknown, Grabiński builds suspense through the gradual and slow unfolding of the plot, which is not without occult and paranormal elements.

This book demands some effort from the reader. Grabiński's almost poetic language, combined with the vague plot, makes it easy to lose track of where our hero actually is. The entire story is saturated with symbols and allegories, which only add another layer to the mysterious yet ambiguous atmosphere Grabiński creates.
