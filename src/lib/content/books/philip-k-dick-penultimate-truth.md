This is a novel for those who enjoy dystopian worlds, a post-apocalyptic atmosphere, and themes related to propaganda. At the time of this book's writing (the 1960s), the themes explored in the novel were a significant part of the public debate of the time. The Cold War for dominance between the USSR and the USA was raging.

The novel's plot is based on these very elements. It depicts a world devastated by nuclear war. Humanity remains underground, believing that military operations are still ongoing. However, the situation on the surface is different from what the authorities are portraying, and the population trapped underground has no way of learning the truth.

The action unfolds primarily from the perspective of a member of one of these underground communities, who is sent to the surface to find an artificial organ for one of the settlement's key figures. We are presented with a world in which a handful of people have seized the planet's entire resources, and the rest of humanity is deceived by propaganda messages in order to control them. This depiction of the hierarchy of social relationships is reminiscent of Orwell's novel, 1984. Much of the plot revolves around intrigues and conspiracies hatched by decision-makers on the surface to seize as much power and influence as possible. I admit, this element was the book's biggest problem for me. I got lost in the web of connections—who was conspiring with whom and against whom. However, for a relatively short novel, there are many elements that could have been developed. There are expeditions to Mars and Venus, robot armies in the service of politicians, a war between fictional fractions (meant to represent the USA and the USSR), artificial organs, and other futuristic elements that Dick managed to fit into this novel.

I really enjoy post-apocalyptic themes. I'm always intrigued by what the world might look like in the face of a catastrophe that could affect us all. The scenario Dick proposes isn't optimistic, but it was a rewarding read.
