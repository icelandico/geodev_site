A collection of short stories and events related to city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gdynia">Gdynia</a> (Poland).

The whole thing is somewhat disappointing as we learn nothing but generally known facts about the life of the city. Some stories could be more detailed, on the other hand there a lot of redundant information about the historic figures.

As a resident of the region, I read this book with some hopes but treat it as a rather amateurish work.
