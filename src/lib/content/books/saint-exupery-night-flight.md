A short novel describing the assistance of a pilot operating a mail shipment in South America. The action takes place in the 1930s, so the world and technology described are obviously at a different level than today. Pioneering solutions at that time, lack of communication, navigation or weather damage, which caused many problems with pilots, especially during night flights.

The novel presents us with the challenges that pilots face and the environment of their work. The return of the family pilot. The director of the airline does not care about the fate of the pilots under his care and wants to apply the standards set by the company.

It is a short but very concise novel that presents a man's reflections on dreams (for aviation), love (for the creation of people) and responsibility.
