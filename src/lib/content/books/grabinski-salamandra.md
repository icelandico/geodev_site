A novella about ophthalmology, in which many threads intertwine. It's noteworthy that there are so many elements related to the main theme.

We find passages about Satanism, witches, voodoo, demons, astral travel, parapsychology, and hedonism. I admire the author for including topics from so many fields. Grabiński was known for his interest in these topics, and he successfully incorporated his knowledge into his work.

I didn't like the main character. He made surprising and illogical choices and seemed lost in the situation he found himself in. I attribute this to the fact that things happening around him are detached from reality, which doesn't positively impact his ability to assess the situation correctly. In some parts of the book, I also felt lost in the plot. There was a lot going on, yet the book isn't long.

What always sets Grabiński apart, and what I greatly appreciate, is his literary style. The author's narrative is composed of a sophisticated, old-fashioned vocabulary, eerie similes, and highly ornate descriptions of buildings, cities, vegetation, and even the weather. Balancing on the border between prose and poetry, this creates a dreamlike, and at times Gothic and eerie, atmosphere in his novels.
