The title might suggest that this is a reportage or notes from a journey. It's not. Actually, it is—but not in the way I expected. The author struggled with addiction to alcohol and psychoactive substances. This book is a chronicle of his experiences from the period when he managed to overcome his addiction and start his life anew. One of the elements that helped him in this process were his trips to the countries of the former USSR.

What attracted me to this book and interested me most, however, disappointed me. His journeys are short and uninteresting. As part of his therapy, the author set himself the goal of "ticking in" places he found in an old guidebook to the USSR. Trips to Kazakhstan, Murmansk, and Tajikistan are brief, and I missed the author's in-depth descriptions of his experiences there. However, I understand that this was the intention. It wasn't meant to be a reportage, but a personal narrative about coping with a very difficult period in life. 

The author's writing style caught my attention. At the same time, it's very casual, vulgar, and very humorous and self-deprecating. I liked Juliusz's approach to his past, with a great deal of distance, self-criticism, and humor.
