A collection of excellent short stories from the master of cosmic horror. Lovecraft's narrative style and plot development are highly repetitive. Many readers find him predictable and boring. For me, this isn't a flaw. Quite the opposite. Combined with the very specific, often archaic language, this creates a work of unique quality, in my opinion.

This collection includes the following stories:

**"The Dunwich Horror"**

Like "The Shadow Over Innsmouth," this is one of the most important works set in the Cthulhu Mythos.

Mysterious and violent events begin to unfold in the titular Dunwich after the death of the deformed Wilbur Whateley. A group of scientists slowly uncovers what may have caused these events.

The story successfully combines local beliefs with the cosmic scale of evil and ancient mysteries. Although I find the story rather dull, it does contain the essential elements of Lovecraftian prose: dark family secrets, occult rituals, and a confrontation with evil from another dimension.

**"The Music of Erich Zann"**

A student renting a room in a strange city meets the neighboring roommate, Erich Zann. He is a deaf musician who plays the cello. The student's attention is drawn to the mysterious and unsettling music he plays.
This isn't a story that directly uses motifs known from the Cthulhu Mythos. I'm not even sure if the author intended that. However, the tone of the story and the gradual tension suggest that the main characters are dealing with forces related to Cthulhu. The story is good and very atmospheric. It's a shame it's so short.

**"The Shadow Over Innsmouth"**

My favorite story by the author. A young student is traveling through New England. He finds himself in the secluded port town of Innsmouth. While exploring the town and talking to a local drunkard, he accidentally learns about the terrible and disturbing history of the town and its inhabitants.

This story has everything that attracts me to Lovecraft's work: the slow-paced action, the long and insightful descriptions of the characters' thoughts, and the buildup of tension. The story ends, of course, with the protagonist's madness. The plot reveals many elements from the Cthulhu world, which are a key part of the author's work. It features the motif of an evil civilization offering humanity certain powers in exchange for cultivating mythical creatures and sacrificing a portion of its humanity. I find the way Lovecraft depicts the port town and its mysterious inhabitants, ancient rituals, and the histories of mythical beings eerie.

**"Nameless City"**

This story is considered the first set in the world of the Cthulhu Mythos. The action is set on the Arabian Peninsula, which is highly unusual for the author, given his affinity for New England.

The unnamed narrator searches for the titular Unnamed City. After discovering the ruins of a temple, he decides to explore it further. This leads him to a place full of corridors, mysterious wall paintings, and coffins filled with strange, reptilian creatures.

The work lacks the horror and madness of other stories. Together with the protagonist, we slowly uncover ancient ruins that conceal an unknown secret.
