This is one of the first novels published by this author. Or rather, a novella, as it is a relatively short work. Although Dick was still developing as a writer, I already notice in this work the qualities for which he is known and which are present in his later, more famous works.

We learn the story of the main character, who returns to his hometown in Virginia after many years. During his brief stay in Millgate, however, he notices many discrepancies between what he remembers from his childhood when he left town and what the town looks like today. And this is where Dick's signature technique begins. As new characters appear and further elements of the world are discovered, we lose track of what is real and tangible and what is happening in the characters' heads. Until halfway through the book, the mood Dick creates reminded me of Stephen King's books: a sleepy town on the outskirts, a theater of supernatural forces at work.

I got the impression that many of the storylines were shortened and sped up to accommodate the publisher's required length. At times, the action moves very quickly, as if by shortcuts. I wasn't particularly fond of the ending. It falls far short of the novel's mysterious opening, though I found the concept itself very original.

This is a rather niche novel and falls short of the author's best-known works. However, it's worth reading for its interesting plot development and the "naive" narrative style characteristic of this genre in the 1950s.
