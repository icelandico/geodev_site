The subject of the book is an area that probably few people know and associate with. Abkhazia is located on the border of Europe and Asia. Officially, it is part of Georgia, but in the early 1990s it declared independence. Almost no other country in the world recognizes Abkhazia.



The author knows the region well. Thanks to his book, we have the opportunity to find out what life was like there during the war (1992-1993), what the local political scene looks like, what ordinary inhabitants of this unrecognized country talk about. During his travels to the Caucasus region, Wojciech Górecki collected an impressive number of small stories, facts and personalities. Thanks to this book, we will find out where the idea for this country came from, why it does not want to be part of Georgia and why it is so attracted to Russia.



The book covers a lot of topics in a rather small space of pages. It gives the impression of chaos and lack of order. I was encouraged to explore almost each of these threads on my own after reading this book.
