It's been over a year since I last read Stephen King. I finished the Dark Tower series back then. I returned to this author and read a book that has some connection to the world depicted in the series with Roland Deschain.

In the small, forgotten mining town of Desperation, Nevada, a kind of evil force appears. The main characters (of which there are quite a few) must confront it, even though they arrived there by accident.

Those who don't like King won't like this book either. There are many character descriptions, a somewhat drawn-out plot, some strange erotic themes, and a bit of gore. What I really appreciate about King's work is the multiple layers of narrative. We learn about Desperation from the perspective of each character, including the negative ones. The reference to The Dark Tower is also a big plus for me, although it's a subtle one. This novel can be treated as a supplement to knowledge of this universe. This is a dark and unsettling novel, primarily due to its setting in a deserted town and the mysterious force raging there. The action is well complemented by a strong religious theme, embodied by one of the main characters.

A good novel. I'm about to read "The Regulators," which was published alongside "Desperation."
