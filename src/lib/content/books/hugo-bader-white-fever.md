A rather depressing book describing the author's journey to the east of Russia, while also describing many of the country's problems. Particular emphasis is placed on the areas of Siberia and the problems of the indigenous, non-Russian population. The author has extensive experience in traveling and describing this part of the world. So it is a reliable reportage, full of conversations with people he meets during his journey.

At first, it may seem that the book is only a description of the journey the author took. He planned to travel from Moscow to Vladivostok in an old, although modified UAZ vehicle. However, the description of preparing for the journey and the drive itself takes up a dozen or so pages. So what fills the rest of the book? Good reportage material full of sad descriptions of the reality faced by the inhabitants of the eastern regions of Russia. A characteristic feature of the author's writing style are the conversations he conducts with people he meets and his friends. Many pages of the book are a dialogue, giving the narrative to the person he meets. The problems described are therefore often presented from the perspective of the person to whom the problem relates, it is not just the author's description.

In short, it is a presentation of problems such as: alcoholism, especially among indigenous ethnic minorities, drug addiction, the gap in living standards between Moscow and the rest of the country, widespread corruption and general post-communist stagnation. I can partially confirm the picture the author presents, because I have visited several former soviet republics. I also read many studies related to this region. Despite some progress, unfortunately, the stigma of the previous system is still visible there, as well as many shortcomings that burden the societies of these countries.

From the content of the book and my observations of this region, I can draw the following conclusion: the world is changing, most of the country is making progress in many areas, societies are striving to improve the quality of life and a stable political and economic situation. This is happening in many places in the world, but not in Russia. Hopelessness in this country continues and there is no indication that the situation will change for the better.
