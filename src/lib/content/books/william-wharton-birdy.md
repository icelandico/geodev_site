I've heard and read about this book a lot. One of many books that you should or must read.

For me it was a though hard to finish this story. I understood it to be a story about the trauma caused by war and the friendship between two boys. With that said, I perceived the story more as a memoir of being teenagers and all the problems that come with that. What hinders me in properly assessing this book is the author's writing style, the symbolism and the poetic tone that appears here.

I should probably read the book again. This time more thoroughly and carefully.
