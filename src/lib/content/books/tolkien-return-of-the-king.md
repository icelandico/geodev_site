The conclusion of an epic adventure that captivated my reading attention for hours. Another volume filled with descriptions of the lands of Middle-earth, great battles, and the adventures of the hobbits as they travel through Mordor on their quest to destroy the Ring. As in the previous installment, the novel is divided into two large chapters. At the end, the fates of both separated heroes intertwine.

"The Return of the King" features even more descriptions of duels and battles. The greatest strength for me was the magnificent depiction of the siege of Minas Tirith. It was presented from the perspective of each group of characters, wonderfully conveying the atmosphere of war, the fear of the heroes, and the terror engendered by the Mordor forces.

The motif of the hobbits' return to Hobbiton and its recapture from Saruman and his followers was a major surprise for me. This part of the story was not depicted in the film, and in my opinion, it would make a great book or film in its own right.

This is a book whose style seems typical of most fantasy novels. It is epic and full of pathos, presenting the struggle between good and evil in a very clear way. The choice of hobbits — a small, modest heroes from a peaceful land who save the world—also seems very cliché. I consider the entire trilogy one of the best and most important books I've ever read. The beautifully crafted world, distinctive characters, and the atmosphere of the Fellowship's journey also made it a wonderful read.
