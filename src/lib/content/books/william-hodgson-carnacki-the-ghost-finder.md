I have a strong sentiment for this author. His novel "The house on the borderlands" was one of the first horror novels I've ever read. It is also one of the books that I read several times.

This title can also be classified as a horror novel. It is a collection of short stories connected by the main character - Thomas Carnacki, who investigates paranormal phenomena. After reading two stories, we already know what to expect from the next ones. Every song starts and ends in almost the same way, very predictably.

Most of the stories presented here, however, are somehow "scary" and naive at the same time. As long as you understand what horror in the 19th century is all about.
