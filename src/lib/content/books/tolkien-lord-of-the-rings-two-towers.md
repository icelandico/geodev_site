The second part of the adventures of the Fellowship of the Ring. This time the novel is divided into two separate parts - one describes the fates of Gimli, Legolas and Aragorn. In the second part we will learn the fates of Sam and Frodo on their way to Mordor.

In "The Two Towers" we will learn even more about Middle-earth. We will learn about more lands, stories of old times, kings and fantastic creatures (ents!). Tolkien created a wonderful, extensive and coherent world, which he describes in a very sublime and insightful way in his novel. However, what delights me for many readers is a big minus. The lengthy descriptions of landscapes and their detail are, however, one of the main advantages for me.

I liked the first part describing the part of the Fellowship with Aragorn much more. There was definitely more action, descriptions of battles and skirmishes. Although the adventures of Frodo and Sam were not full of such dynamic events, I liked the building of tension as we approached the gates of Mordor.

The Two Towers is a darker part than the previous one. The philosophical elements and moral dilemmas discussed by the characters add value to this novel. Its strength for me lies in the fairy-tale world, the developed mythology and the large moral foundation that the author smuggles into his novel. A great sequel.
