I like books that combine popular science literature and general knowledge. This book is very well known and, in addition, has caused controversy in certain circles.

Overall, for most of the book, the author neatly summarizes the history of humanity as a species. There are no new and revealing theories here, these are tidy facts that are familiar to most of us. Yet in each chapter there are the author's thoughts on a particular topic, and sometimes he shares with the reader theses that may seem a bit stilted or controversial. For me, the author's claims are not controversial. 

It was a very good read. This book forced one to reflect on a rather general and superficial topic. How much humanity dominates the vast natural resources and directs the development (or rather, destruction) of entire ecosystems.
