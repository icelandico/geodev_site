I've read it right after I finished the first book about the Moomintrolls. 

Comet in Moominland" by Tove Jansson is a captivating and imaginative book that takes readers on a thrilling journey alongside the beloved Moomin characters. As the second installment in the Moomins series, it builds upon the enchanting world introduced in "The Moomins and the Great Flood" while offering new and exciting experiences. It is much more elaborate and in my opinion - more serious. For a book of about 200 pages, there is a lot going on here. As is usually the case in children's literature, there is a lot of simplification, the plot jumps around quickly and new characters appear unexpectedly.

As in the previous book, this one skillfully explores themes of friendship, courage, and the awe-inspiring power of nature, all while delivering an engaging and suspenseful plot.
Also, I really like the world created by the author. From the perilous forests to the mysterious caves, every setting is beautifully described, transporting readers into the heart of the adventure. Jansson's illustrations further enhance the reading experience, immersing readers in the diversity of the Moomin universe.
