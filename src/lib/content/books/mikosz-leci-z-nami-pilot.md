How the aviation market works described by a former director of the Polish flag carrier PLL LOT. Various aspects of this very interesting (to me) industry are discussed here. Among other things, we will learn about how ticket prices are determined, what makes up the price, how the catering provided on board the plane works or how the entire flight procedure is organized.

The author shares his extensive experience - he is not only a frequent passenger, but was responsible for the organization of one of the largest carriers in Europe. A big surprise for me was the history of the Concorde aircraft - I knew little about it before reading the book.

The book was published in 2011. Since then, the aviation market has experienced many changes, including the biggest shock in the form of the COVID pandemic, which stopped air traffic for several months. I think the author could publish a separate book on the subject. The only downside is the writing style. This is probably the author's first major publication that isn't a report or an account. Nevertheless, it is a very pleasant to read collection of interesting facts and non-obvious information from the world of aviation.
