The second novel by a Polish science fiction writer, published in 1975.
The plot presents events on board an spaceplane that goes on a long journey to explore planets. During the voyage, events that are difficult to explain occur - some of the crew members fall into a coma. The main character conducts an investigation while trying to perform his duties and conduct the mission in order.

There are detective, sociological and ethical threads here. The author is known for not focusing on technical issues in his novels (although such elements do occur). A lot of dialogue and the main character's thoughts make us focus on the analysis of the situation he finds himself in and the assessment of his (and other characters') motives for action.

I really liked the intertwining of three separate stories within the content of the main plot. These are stories read by the main character and a report from the past. All of these stories are connected to the plot of the novel. For me, these are the elements that make the book very attractive and engaging.

The only downside for me is the author's writing style. The plot is naive in some places and the dialogues are shallow. I have the impression that the book is intended for younger readers (teenagers?).

In my opinion, this is a solid novel by this author. I liked the slightly surprising ending, which made me think about possible contact between humanity and another civilization.
