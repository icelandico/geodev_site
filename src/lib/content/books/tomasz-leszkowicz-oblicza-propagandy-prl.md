Short book regarding propaganda in Polish People's Republic.

In my opinion, it is rather a description of a particular events of 1945-1990. The subject of propaganda is showed in a superficial way. I expected that the techniques of manipulation used by the Polish authorities at that time would be described in more detail. For people unfamiliar with how the authorities in the Polish People's Republic operated, this book will be an introduction to broadening their knowledge on this subject.
