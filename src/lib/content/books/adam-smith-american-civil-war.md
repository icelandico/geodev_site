The vast subject of the Civil War requires a somewhat different approach in literature. There are thousands of studies and books focusing on selected details of this conflict, such as individual battles. Adam Smith's book, at approximately 300 pages, was intended to be a summary of the Civil War, describing the causes, effects, course, and general state of the country in the years leading up to the war.

Considering the vast amount of facts and available literature, I believe this is a good book if we want to learn more than the very general outline familiar from history classes (of course, I'm writing this from the perspective of a resident of Europe, where this topic is present in the curriculum, but only at a rudimentary level).

I appreciated the inclusion of clippings from contemporary newspaper articles (North and South) and the citations of excerpts from letters from residents and soldiers on both sides. This is a valuable tool that shows the human side of the conflict, not just from the perspective of political decisions and troop movements.

I am a US history buff, so this book doesn't exhaust my desire to learn more about this topic. However, this is a very good place to start, most books on this topic are more detailed.
