This year I decided to focus on reading science fiction. I started with a novel published in 1920, which could have been an inspiration (we will never know) for later and much more famous novels such as: 1984, Fahrenheit 451 or Brave New World. The similarity lies in the presentation of the totalitarian system in which the characters of the books live. Elements of killing individualism were present in the past, and can also be observed today.

The plot presents a dystopian future in which people are deprived of personality and free choice. The lives of all citizens of the One State are controlled and reduced to repetitive activities. People also do not have names. Each citizen only has an individual number (the main character is D-503). All behaviors and decisions of people are subordinated to formulas and mathematical calculations of the ruling "Benefactor". This is an original approach, but less convincing than the societies presented in the books of Orwell and Huxley.

The novel does not have a dynamic and uniform plot. It is presented in the form of short notes taken by the main character. The dialogues are short and not very credible. The author's archaic and clumsy writing style was quite difficult for me to read. It was certainly not a pleasant and dynamic read.

"We" is very different stylistically from later works of this genre. However, it is worth reading to learn about the (probable) inspiration for similar works, which contain a futuristic image of a society living in an oppressive and totalitarian state.
