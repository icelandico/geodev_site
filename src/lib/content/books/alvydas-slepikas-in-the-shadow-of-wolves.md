It's a novel that tells the story of a lesser known episode in a post-war Europe's history.

Very moving and intense story about the so-called _wolf children_ - German orphans in East Prussia, who tried to find their way to survive in a new and cruel for them post-war reailty.

The novel is hard. It presents the brutal struggle for the lives of then German inhabitants of present-day Lithuania and Kaliningrad Oblast, both children and adults. It's a fight against the hunger, cold and a new host of these lands - Soviet Union.

As the author himself writes in the epilogue - collecting material for this book was not an easy task. To this day, many witnesses of these terrible events have not survived. Those whom the author found were usually not eager to come back to these memories.
