This timeless classic is a book which I read every year. I've read it as a child and I read it still as an adult. This is the unquestionable strength of this book and its timeless message.

On the surface, it is a charming and whimsical story that can be enjoyed by children for its imaginative and fantastical elements. However, as you delve deeper into the story, you begin to realize that it is a profound exploration of human nature, relationships, and the importance of seeing the world with a childlike sense of wonder.

As a person who has already gathered some life experience (still relatively small), I understand the message of this book much better than when I was a child.

I will definitely reach for this book in the next year.
