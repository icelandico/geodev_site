How to organize our work and life in a modern world? World full of distractions, emails, notifications, calls and meetings. I found this book extremely helpful to solve this issue.
It's not that difficult to work efficient and still have free weekends and afternoons. However, the environment we live in isn't conducive to effective work. Many of us struggle with productivity and concentration on daily tasks.

This is a quality book. Full of good advices, proofs, quotations from scientific papers. The author not only provides examples from his own life that can be implemented, but also provides numerous references to research in psychology or management, which serve as solid evidence for his insights. I only disliked one piece of advice: to focus on solving problems we couldn't tackle at any other time during the day (e.g., while running). Perhaps this is a disguised workaholism of the author, revealed in this passage.

In a world dominated by shallow communication and low-quality content, deep work is incredibly valuable. Thanks to this book, we can introduce improvements into our lives that will improve the quality of our daily work.
