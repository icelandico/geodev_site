Erich Maria Remarque's classic novel about how war changes people and society. The main character, Greaber, is a Wehrmacht soldier on the eastern front. He sees the various horrors of war - the cold, hunger, the shooting of civilians. However, he has the feeling that he is taking part in something important and the victory of his army is near. Much changes when he returns to his hometown in Germany on leave. 
He sees bombed-out houses, mutilated soldiers, rumors of the front retreating into Germany reach him. The picture of the army and his homeland is no longer as positive as it seemed.
Under these strange and disturbing circumstances, Graeber experiences love. Passing days in peace are mixed with his anxiety and fear, as he soon has to return to the front. He also begins to feel his responsibility in the ongoing war.

Two completely different images collide in the novel: war and love. The author's literary style is difficult in my opinion. I read the book quite slowly, however, in many places I appreciated how the author operates with words. 

I think it is a very important novel, one of those that everyone should read. Brilliantly shown the senselessness of war and at the same time presented against this background the bond between people and the transformation of the character of the main character.
