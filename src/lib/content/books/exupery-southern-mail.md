In addition to reportage or popular literature, I also try to read more so-called classic literature. However, this is a type of literature that does not fall into my memory. A well-known author, serious literature, however, the subject matter did not appeal to me so much that I find it hard to evaluate this book positively. The issues raised by the author are familiar and universal - friendship, emotions, love, support and relationships with a loved one. 

I had a hard time getting through the author's thoughts and message. It was more difficult than with the previous two novellas.
