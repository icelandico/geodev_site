The author's personal memories from a flight in 1940 when he served in the French Air Force.

The narrative has two sides, completely different from each other. On the one hand, there are technical issues related to the flight, operation of the machine, and communication between crew members. From time to time, the author describes what he sees on the ground from the perspective of flight. Columns of thousands of French refugees fleeing from the German army. Chaos, destroyed villages and cities. The once peaceful and rural France is systematically burned and razed to the ground before the author's eyes.

The author's thoughts are the main value of this book. We live in the comfort of the 21st century, we have access to various amenities and a sense of security. These elements should be valued and nurtured.
