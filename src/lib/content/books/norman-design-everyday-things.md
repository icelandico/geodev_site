This book is considered as a classic when it comes to design and applied arts. I'll admit it, it was hard for me to get through some chapters. The author does have a lot of knowledge on the subject. However, many of the examples he cites seem unrealistic and far-fetched to me. 

The location of buttons on the refrigerator, a poorly designed door, and a sink drain are just some of the examples that the author breaks down. And very often - he pays too much attention to academic theory in my opinion.

There is a lot about psychology here, how people perceive objects when they are used. These are interesting topics, but it's hard to put it into practice in everyday life. Again, this is mostly academic word salad.

I was hoping that the author would present more examples of bad and good design. I was hoping for more references to real-life examples, historical mistakes and successes in designing 'things'. Unfortunately, I was disappointed because these elements complements the author's psychological arguments and some stories from his life.
