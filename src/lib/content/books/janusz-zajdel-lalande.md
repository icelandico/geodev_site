This is the first novel by a well-known (at least in my country) science fiction author, published in 1966.

The plot presents the fate of a research mission that arrived in the titular Lalande system. Many scientists of different specializations (geologists, linguists, biologists, engineers) take part in the mission to study two planets of this system. Most of the events are presented from the perspective of teenage participants of the expedition, who were born during the journey. They only know Earth from the stories of their elders and literature. Zajdel wanted to present the motives and thoughts of people who may find themselves in such a situation in the future. However, this is the weakest point of the novel, because the dialogues of the teenage characters are, in my opinion, very unnatural and naive. For this reason, in my opinion (similarly to *Prawo do powrotu*) it is a novel addressed to younger readers.

A common motif of this author is showing the attempt of humans to discover newly discovered planets. The characters in Zajdel's novels want to understand and learn about unknown worlds with only the knowledge acquired on our planet. Can this be achieved? There are many simplifications and unnecessary dialogues between characters. The action sometimes moves quickly and in an inconsistent manner.

I am cautious in criticizing this book, because it is the author's first novel. This is evident from the rather infantile way of conducting the plot and logical errors. Despite everything, it is a successful book. I was curious about the thoughts of such a research team that arrives on an unknown planet and tries to decipher the riddles that they encounter in this new world.
