This is a very extensive commentary and analysis of the phenomenon of Donald Trump's adoration among right-wing circles in Poland.
This type of political commentary and analysis isn't the kind of book I read often. Like most people, I have my own views on many issues and respect the views of others. My problem with such books is that the author's views overshadow the substantive value they should present. This is evident in this book.

I'm not a fan of Donald Trump. I dislike his inflated ego, narcissism, incompetence, and the aura of a great leader projected by Republican circles in the US. However, he is serving his second term as US president, and this fact shouldn't be underestimated.

The authors are very strong critics of D.J. Trump's policies and his person. They describe the scandals surrounding him, his political choices, and the people he surrounds himself with. The book's main focus, however, is an analysis of why the current (2025) US president is so adored in Poland.

It contains a vast number of facts, names, events, and dates. The authors did a tremendous job gathering the material for this book. At the end of the book, there's a separate chapter with sources and a bibliography, spanning several dozen pages. Although I actively follow the situation in the US, thanks to this publication, I learned much more about the circles closely associated with Donald Trump. Therefore, I consider it a valuable work, albeit highly biased. The authors established a thesis from the outset and wrote the book around it.

PS: The title is a pun. It combines the words "Trump" and "Poles." (Polacy).
