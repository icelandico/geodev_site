A﻿nother great book of this author. If you're intested in politics and culture of the Caucasus region, you had or have to read his books and articles.

__Toast za przodków__ is the second part in his three-part series on the Caucasus. Here you will find stories and experiences gathered during many trips and several years of living in the region (Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan). If you have not been interested in the situation in the region so far - you may feel lost. The topics covered here may require a basic knowledge of the specifics of the region.

This is a book between a reportage and a historical publication. For me a great and accessible read, however, I realize that for others it may just be hard to read.
