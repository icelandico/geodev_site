A collection of very short, ironic, and grotesque stories by an Israeli writer.

I must admit that many of them were difficult for me to interpret, even though most of them are only a few pages long. The stories described by the author are also specific to the inhabitants of Israel, therefore their interpretation may be difficult for people unfamiliar with the local social situation.

However, I liked the absurd humor and absurd situations which encouraged me to explore this author's work.
