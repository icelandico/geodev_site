I have been reading this book for longer than I anticipated.Until now, I am only familiar with Irving's work because of the novel "The Cider House Rules". "The Water Method Man" is much weaker in many ways. But it is also only the second novel in this author's oeuvre.
 

The long fragments of this book are a bore. The main character's thoughts seem trivial and irrelevant. I also find it hard to understand his life choices and how he complicated his life.



While reading this novel I was waiting for something. I was hoping something would happen. A sudden twist or a finesse punch line? I didn't get it. It was only after finishing this book that I appreciated it more. It is well simply a literarily solidly written novel.
