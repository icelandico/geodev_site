A grim version of the future created by one of my favorite writers. In the introduction, we learn that the novel was inspired by game theory, which Dick was interested in the 50's.

It is a vision of the world in which a logic, numbers and coincidence creates reality. A random person chosen by the System becomes the leader of the Solar System. In addition to this privilege of enormous power, such a person must also take care of their own safety and survival. Together with his election, assassins begin their work, whose task is to eliminate the reigning Quizmaster (the official title of the leader) in order to ensure the continuity of the system's operation and provide entertainment to the inhabitants of the System.

There is more action here than philosophical reflections, which I got used to reading his later novels. This is his first published novel. At such an early stage of his literary career, however, it is clear from his style in which direction the author will develop. A not very optimistic vision of the future, the mechanisms of society and intrigues related to power and politics are elements that are important points in the author's work, and it is no different in The Solar Lottery. What I liked less was the predictability of the ending and the general chaos in the second part of the novel. In my opinion, the book is too short to present the threads that were started in a reliable way.

There is no point in comparing this book to his most famous titles. Nevertheless, it is a very solid introduction to the work of this author.
