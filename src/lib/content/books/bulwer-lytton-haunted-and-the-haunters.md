Another old-school horror novel. I used to read more books in this genre. I really like the way of narration and the mood created in old horror novels and Gothic literature. This novel is no different.

A detective dealing with supernatural phenomena visits an old house that is supposedly haunted. The plot is similar to many such "ghost story" novels. What I especially like is the building of tension, descriptions of supernatural events and the characteristic, outdated language used by the characters. The ending, in which the mystery related to the haunted place is explained, is worth noting.

This is not as developed a work as those written by Poe or Shelley. However, in my opinion, it is a solid "ghost story" that a fan of this genre should familiarize themselves with.
