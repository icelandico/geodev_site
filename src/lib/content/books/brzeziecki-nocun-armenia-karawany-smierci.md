Another reportage whose subject is the region of the former USSR. In this case it is Armenia. The first Christian state in history, once powerful and influential. Known for its centuries-old culture. Today it is a country mired in corruption. At war with Azerbaijan over disputed territory - Nagorno-Karabakh. A country plagued by large emigration and slim chances for stable economic development.

The authors devote each chapter to a different problem facing Armenia. Among the most important are:
- corruption of the political elite,
- the issue of the Armenian genocide,
- the war in Nagorno-Karabakh,
- myths, legends and traditions and their impact on daily life,
- ties with Russia and its influence on the situation in the country.

The topics covered here are not easy or pleasant to read. Rather, what emerges from the authors' accounts is the grim daily reality of the country and the trauma the nation has endured over the past decades. The book is short. Each chapter rather vaguely illustrates the issues presented. However, it is a good introduction to further exploration of the history, politics and culture of this corner of the world.
