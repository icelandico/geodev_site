After many years I wanted to go through the work of Tove Jansson again.

It is a short story with many adventures .For the first time, we meet the titular Moomins - so far, Moominmamma and the Moomintroll. They roam the dark world in search of Daddy Mummy.   With the help of a diverse cast of weird characters like  Such as the constantly frightened Sniff, Moomintroll's search takes him through perilous landscapes and encounters with both friends and foes.
A huge value for the reception of this book is the author's illustrations. On the one hand innocent, simple and fairy-tale-like. At the same time, stimulating the imagination and even a little scary. But overall Tove Jansson's unique artistic style, characterized by delicate lines and soft colors, perfectly complements the imaginative world of the Moomins.

In conclusion, "The Moomins and the Great Flood" is a charming and timeless book that captures the imagination and leaves a lasting impression. With its captivating storyline, lovable characters, and enchanting illustrations, it is a must-read for anyone seeking a delightful escape into a world filled with the enduring power of family, friendship and core values.
