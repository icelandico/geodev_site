Lovecraft's stories are so unique that I find myself drawn back to his work every time. The author's style is highly repetitive, and the same patterns can be seen in almost every one of his stories. These are not typical third-person narratives. His stories often read like the main character's confessions, devoid of dialogue but with extensive descriptions of nature and repeated emphasis on the eerie atmosphere of the place. Despite this formulaic nature, I find immense value in each story, a wonderful way of developing the narrative and presenting events that are difficult to describe from the characters' perspectives.

This collection includes the following stories:

**"The Doom that came to Sarnath"**

The inhabitants of the mighty city of Sarnath lived near a lake inhabited by mysterious beings. After subjugating them and destroying their culture, the city was doomed, leading to the decline of the city's status and the madness of its inhabitants.

**"Pickman's Model"**

A Boston painter draws inspiration for his paintings from a reality other than the one we know. This is a very typical Lovecraftian story. We don't learn the details from the protagonist's descriptions. We must challenge our own imagination and imagine what the titular Pickman saw and what he did to continue his work.

**"The Whisperer in Darkness"**

One of my favorite stories by the author. The action takes place in a remote corner of Vermont. The main character hears rumors of strange creatures seen in the area and mysterious phenomena that have been observed simultaneously. The events are presented primarily through an exchange of correspondence between the protagonist, an expert on New England folklore, and a farmer who tries to divine the origins of the mysterious creatures on his own.

**"Herbert West - Reanimator"**

In this case, Lovecraft must have been inspired by "Frankenstein." However, it lacks the romanticism of Mary Shelley's work. The titular character, Herber West, is a medical student completely consumed by his attempts to experiment on human corpses in an attempt to bring them back to life. The mad doctor gradually descends into the depths of madness to perfect his experiments.

**"The Color Out of Space"**

A cosmic horror in a very literal sense. A mysterious meteorite crashes onto a New England farm. Soon, strange things begin to happen to the nearby plants, animals, and people. Although there are no elements from the Cthulhu Mythos, the familiar motifs of madness and fear of the unknown are present. Once again, a wonderful, mysterious New England atmosphere. A glimpse into something unknown to humanity that may initially spark interest but ultimately leads to fear and madness.
