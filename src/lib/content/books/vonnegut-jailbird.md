There are few books whose reading makes me smile sincerely. In my opinion, Kurt Vonnegut can do it best. 
There is an atmosphere here similar to other books by the author - “Cat's Cradle” or “Slaughterhouse Number Five”. 

The main character, who is a clumsy and awkward person in life - is embroiled in a very high-profile affair on a national scale. Although in the whole situation he is only a pawn and an insignificant piece of the whole puzzle - his life will be turned upside down.

This is a strongly political book. The main motive of the novel is the Watergate affair, one of the biggest political turmoil in US history. Thus, it is worth knowing at least an outline of 20th century US history to better understand the public mood that prevailed in the country at the time.

As is often the case with Vonnegut - real events are intertwined with fantastic ones, creating an interesting satire and commentary by the author on American society. Knowing the author's views (he described himself as a socialist), we are not surprised here by the veiled criticism of large corporations, consumerism, the pursuit of power and the motivations of politicians (power and money).

What delights in this book is the black humor, satire, absurd moments and a great combination of historical events and fiction. However, this is not a Vonnegut novel that I would recommend reading to people who are not familiar with the author's work. It is quite chaotic and can seem incoherent, and the Watergate affair is specific to the US and not everyone can relate to this context of US history.
