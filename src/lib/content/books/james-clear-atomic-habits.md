I﻿ don't read books like "Make you life better in 10 steps" or "Smile and become a millionaire". When I first heard about this book I thought it was another guidebook in this style. It's not.

I﻿ would call it a framework that author recommends for creating and sustaining positive habits. The author provides numerous examples and stories from his life to illustrate these principles. These advices are written in such a way that you have to adjust these rules to your personal choices and life goals.

I﻿ found this book as a very practical and insightful guide to make your life easier. It's a good point to start with if you want getting better at being human.
