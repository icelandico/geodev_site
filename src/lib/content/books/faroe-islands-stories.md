The Faroe Islands - A land that few people know anything about. It's a cold, rainy and windy archipelago situated between the Great Britain and Iceland in the North Atlantic Ocean. It's a home to a small population of some very interesting stories.

The two authors spent together several years on the islands, had the opportunity to meet dozens of people and present their stories in the book. Considering that the population of Faroe Islands is about 50000 people, it can be said that they managed to meet personally with a representative part of the population. There are a lot of facts here, some relevant, some rather trivial and unimportant. I got the impression that in many situations there was a lack of chapter ideas and something had to fill the book. 

Nevertheless, it is a very interesting position. After finishing it, I spent many hours on google maps, looking for the towns and other places (villages) that the authors visited. It is a very fascinating piece of our world - because of its amazing landscapes and inaccessibility.
