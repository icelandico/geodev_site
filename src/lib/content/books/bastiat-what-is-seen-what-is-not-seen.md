A very short economic argument from 1850. The author presents his thoughts and solutions to certain economic problems. This is the time when the idea of ​​socialism and state intervention in the economy was taking shape. The author clearly opposes both ideas.

The author does not use complicated, academic language - his arguments are presented in a simple and concise form. Another convenience is the fact that Bastiat gives examples from everyday life at the time, which makes it easier to place a given situation in the real world.

Although the book was written 175 years ago, many of the ideas presented by the author are still relevant. For me, this is a very good example of professional argumentation of one's own beliefs and application of knowledge (in this case - economic) in practice. I return to this short publication from time to time. I believe that it is a very valuable introduction to further deepening my knowledge of economics.
