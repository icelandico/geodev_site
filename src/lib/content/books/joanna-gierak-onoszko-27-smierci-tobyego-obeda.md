What an amazing book. Shocking and instructive. Probably the most important thing I've read this year.

Few people know about the history of people from the so-called First Nations in Canada - descendants of indigenous people. Years of humiliation and systemic destruction of their culture, tradition and identity. This case has been highlighted in recent years by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada.

Particularly shocking are the fragments that are memories of people who experienced violence and humiliation because of their origin. In many places it is very difficult to read. However, I believe that the events described by the author should be documented as best as possible.

So far, the book has only been published in Polish.
