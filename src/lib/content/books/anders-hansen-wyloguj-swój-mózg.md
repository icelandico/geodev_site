Popular science title. The author shares the results of his research on how the use of modern media and media (e.g. smartphone) affects our well-being and mental state. His conclusions are very interesting and at the same time terrifying.



Here we will find some advice on how to find yourself in a world full of unnecessary information and stimuli. It is worth reading to revise your approach to using the phone and other new technologies that surround us in an increasingly tight loop. I'm surprised this book hasn't been published in English yet.
