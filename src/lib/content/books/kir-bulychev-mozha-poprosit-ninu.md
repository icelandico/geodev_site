The author is one of the most recognized and famous Russian science-fiction writers. I have read only a few books in the past, and his bibliography is very impressive. I recommend fans of the genre to get acquainted with the works of this author, it's an important and influential part of this genre.

The plot of this short story is primarily a telephone conversation between an adult man and a teenage girl. In the course of the conversation, we learn more and more about them and what conditions they are currently in.

The story is a bit disturbing and made a big impression on me.
