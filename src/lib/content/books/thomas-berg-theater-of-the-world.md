Geography and cartography. Two very important fields for me. I sat down to read this book with pleasure and hope for a lot of new information.

Generally speaking, it's a brief history of cartography and important figures in this field. I expected more details about how the technique of making maps and measurements changed - that is, how the art inextricably linked to cartography - geodesy - was born and developed. I liked the map reprints referenced in the individual chapters. But there could have been more.

It will be a valuable read for both the layman and the person interested in the subject. Although for a person who is not a lover of maps, this may not be an easy and light read
