It is not easy for me to write about books as famous, controversial and groundbreaking as this one.

Roth's writing is characterized by its sharp wit, satirical tone, and relentless energy. The narrative is unapologetically explicit and confronts the reader head-on with its frank discussions of sexual taboos and desires. The author fearlessly exposes the contradictions and hypocrisies of society, particularly in relation to sexuality and religion. The novel's audacity lies in its ability to provoke, challenge, and confront readers' own prejudices and preconceived notions.

I really liked the form of narration and the cursive scenes from life that the main character shares with us. For the most part, it was a very entertaining book for me. The rating I gave may seem low. However, I am comparing the reading of this book to others I have read recently. Despite the entertaining form, the content itself and the main themes presented here are quite distant to me. I certainly should have a better understanding of the specifics and significance of social change in the US in the 1960s.
