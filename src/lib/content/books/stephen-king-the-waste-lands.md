Third part of the "Dark Tower" series. So far my favorite.

It was a good combination of genres where the author is the best. I was amazed by some of the ideas used in this book. There were many surprising elements for me. In addition to the traditionally compact, logical and extensive plot, we also have great character creation of the main characters.

What I like the most in the whole series is the world of the Dark Tower. In this part, we get more information that builds a picture of this post-apocalyptic world. More places, characters, stories, events and legends that build an amazing and mysterious image of this universe.

Another successful book by king, which encourages you to reach for more titles, especially from this series.
