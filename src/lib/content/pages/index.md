transitDiagrams: "Transit diagrams are a thing. There is a large group of people
  who design and draw communication maps. Transit diagrams for existing cities,
  fictional cities, improved versions of existing, poorly designed or old
  diagrams. After months of watching others' work I decided to add my work to
  this community as well. If you're interested in this topic you can find a lot
  of great content <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TransitDiagrams/\"
  target=\"_blank\">on this subreddit </a> and <a
  href=\"https://transitmap.net/\" target=\"_blank\">transitmap site</a>. "
