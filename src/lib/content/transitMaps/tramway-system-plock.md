Płock is a mid-sized city in central Poland in Mazovia region. It has a population of 111 000 inhabitants. In 1975–1998, the city was the capital of the Płock Voivodeship.

The city is the historical capital of Mazovia and played an important role in the history of Poland (in the years 1079–1138 the capital of Poland). Currently, the city is known mainly for one of the largest oil refineries in this region of Europe.

In 2007, the first project of a tram line in the city was created. The line was to be put into service in 2013. Shortly after the environmental study was prepared, the authorities withdrew from the project for financial reasons. 

My project involves the creation of three lines.

### Line 1 

Number of stops: 17
Length: 9.5 km

### Line 2

Number of stops: 14
Length: 7.2 km

### Line 3

Number of stops: 11
Length: 5.7 km
