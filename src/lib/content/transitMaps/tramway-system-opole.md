Opole is a mid-sized city in southern Poland. It is a historical capital of Upper Silesia region. City has a population of 124 000 and is the capital of Opole Voivodeship. Public transport is operated by MZK Opole (Miejski Zakład Komunikacji) and it has 16 regular bus lines, 2 night lines and also 4 lines that provide services in neighboring municipalities.

In 1910, in Opole, a city with 34,000 inhabitants, the idea of ​​building a narrow-gauge railway connecting the city with Prószków was born however the project was never implemented.

Here is my proposal for what the city's tram system could look like.

### Line 1
Number of stops: 16  
Length: 7.2 km

### Line 2
Number of stops: 22  
Length: 11 km

### Line 3
Number of stops: 19  
Length: 8.5 km
