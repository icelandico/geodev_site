Gdynia, a port city located on the Baltic Sea in the Bay of Gdańsk, is the second largest city in the Tricity Agglomeration and the Pomeranian Voivodeship (the largest is Gdańsk, for which an identical map was created in a previous project).

Although Gdańsk and Gdynia are neighboring cities, their terrain differs. Gdynia has more areas above 100 meters above sea level. In the coastal districts of Redłowo, Orłowo, and Oksywie, areas at 50-100 meters above sea level are located within 1 kilometer of the coast.

The highest point within the city limits is considered Mount Donas, at 206.5 meters above sea level. However, the article I used to prepare this map indicates that next to Mount Donas there is a peak approximately 1 meter higher. The map marks the location of Mount Donas, which is well-known to residents, among other reasons, due to the telecommunications tower with an observation deck. It is generally believed that this point is the highest peak in the Tricity.

The map highlights several interesting features of the terrain. On the eastern edge of the city, in the Kamienna Góra and Redłowo districts (peaks 16 and 14), lies the Kępa Redłowska plateau. It features numerous narrow valleys and gorges, with the Orłowski Cliff being the dominant feature.

To the north of the city lies the much larger Kępa Oksywska (peaks 15, 17, 18, 20). The coastal part of this microregion is also characterized by cliffs, but they are lower. Currently, most of this bank has been secured for the safety of residents, as the cliff was dangerously close to residential buildings.

As in the project for Gdańsk - I marked these points based on an excellent series of articles by Tomasz Larczyński, who published them on a local portal. The author also used numerous archival maps and LIDAR measurements to discover the highest points. I made individual height corrections based on readings from topographic maps.
