This year I started to prepare maps on behalf of duo historians, publications written by [Insubrica historica](https://insubricahistorica.ch/).

Insubrica Historica conducts research on heritage and history in the northern regions of Italy - Lombardy and Piedmont and the canton of Ticino in Switzerland. Their works contains publications about World War II, but not only.

I recommend to read their works and articles everyone interested in history, especially the local history. You can learn about facts and events outside the mainstream, and very specific to this region on the border between Italy and Switzerland. 

Every few weeks or months I prepare a map for a post that is published on this blog or for a print job.
