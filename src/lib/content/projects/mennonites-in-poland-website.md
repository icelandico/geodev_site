Virtual exhibition and presentation about Mennonites in Poland. Thanks to this website you can learn about the history of the Mennonites in Poland. Content is divided into four separate chapters. Each of them includes images, explanations, and videos regarding the topic. The website is available in three languages: Polish, English, and German.

The website was created in cooperation with historians and <a href="https://krawczymaciej.tumblr.com/">great graphic designer</a>.

I used Gatsby to generate pages, navigation, and website logic. To handle multiple languages on the website I've used a <a href="https://github.com/wiziple/gatsby-plugin-intl">gatsby-plugin-intl</a>. Really easy to use but I've needed to make it work with my CMS. Content is served thanks to Netlify CMS. The most developer-friendly and flexible CMS I've used so far.
Also, Netlify is used for hosting and deployment.
