description: Difference in the ratio of the two largest discount shops chains in Poland
type: map

Two biggest supermarket chains in Poland are Biedronka and Lidl. The first one has almost 3300 shops in the country, while the latter owns 850 shops. The advantage is very significant.
I wanted to show how this difference in the number of shops of the two biggest chains looks on the map.

I've chosen to show the distribution using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powiat">powiat</a> unit. It's a second-level unit of local government and administration in Poland. There are 380 of them.

Surprisingly, there are three counties in which none of the shops of the two chains are present. There are also only three __powiats__ where Lidl has the same ratio of number of shops to Biedronka. In the rest of the country's regions, far more shops belong to chains with a ladybug in logo (Biedronka).
