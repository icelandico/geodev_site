Transit diagrams are a thing. There is a large group of people who design and draw communication maps. Transit diagrams for existing cities, fictional cities, improved versions of existing, poorly designed or old diagrams. After months of watching others' work I decided to add my work to this community as well. If you're interested in this topic you can find a lot of great content on reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TransitDiagrams/" target="_blank">r/TransitDiagrams </a> and <a href="https://transitmap.net/" target="_blank">transitmap.net</a> site.
