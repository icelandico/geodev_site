HDI (Human Development Index) is a statistic index which considers number of years of schooling, GDP and life expentancy. The index for a whole country (0.876) puts it on a 34th place out of 196. Countries with similar score are:
- Bahrain, Lithuania, Saudi Arabia (0.875)
- Greece (0.887)
- Czech Republic (0.889)

The highest HDI in Poland have these voivodeships:
- Mazovian (including the capital Warsaw) - 0.926
- Lower Silesian - 0.889
- Lesser Poland, Pomeranian - 0.888

The lowest HDI in Poland have following voivodeships:
- Warmian-Masurian - 0.844
- Lubusz, Kuyavian-Pomeranian - 0.858

The highest score is heavily inflated by the capital city. There are opinions among the public for Warsaw to become a separate administrative unit. If this were to happen, the Mazovian Voivodeship without Warsaw would be average at best in terms of socio-economic development. Moreover, Warsaw alone accounts for around 230% of the average national GDP.
This shows how dependent the region is on the capital district.

The lowest scores are recorded by voivodeships without a very large urban centre. Cities such as Toruń, Kielce, Zielona Góra or Olsztyn cannot compete in attracting investment with the largest cities located in other regions.

## How it's made

I found the data on [Global Data Lab](https://globaldatalab.org/). The rest of work was just to put data and shapefiles together using QGis.
For this map I used Merriweather font.
