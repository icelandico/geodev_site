The country that doesn't exist. Or rather exists only in small group of people minds.

Declared it's independence in 1990 is not recognized by any member of the United Nations. The only states that recognize this country are other non-recognized states - Artsakh, Abkhazia, South Ossetia.

This narrow land is officialy part of Moldova but as you can see on the map - not much of this area is under the Moldovan administration.
